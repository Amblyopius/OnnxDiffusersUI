# DiffusersOnnxUI
I created a basic UI for ONNX based Stable Diffusions, specifically for using AMD graphics cards on Windows. This guide is to help people setup Stable Diffusion on their PC.

## Credits
A lot of this document is based on other guides. I've listed them below:

## Pre-requisites
You'll need to install a few things:
- Python: any version between 3.6 to 3.10 will work. I'll be using 3.10 in this guide
- Git: used by huggingface-cli for token authentication
